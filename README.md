## Premise:
### NexGen Calculations was built as an aircraft performance-based application in React Native that is specific to the Cessna 172 Shyhawk. The Cessna is the most widely used aircraft for flight training and general aviation (G.A). The user can provide basic information about their flight, then the application will get the necessary information through AJAX calls and then process them through our algorithms.
### The aviation industry frequently leads the way in advancing technology; however, G.A still relies on methods over 40 years old for these calculations. On average, an experienced pilot will spend at least ten minutes, and a student pilot will easily spend thirty or more performing these computations. Furthermore, there is notable room for error in the interpolation of manually calculated values and paths.
### This app solves these problems by using innovative technology (React Native and Redux) and advanced algorithms that allow users to make extremely accurate and expedient calculations.
### This will be the only publicly available application in the industry for this specific aircraft. I hope to bring this technology to the App store soon.

## User inputs basic flight data for takeoff and landing

## Application will make an AJAX request for the remaining information for both takeoff and landing
### Takeoff

### Landing

### Application will calculate the performance and return the information on a Takeoff and Landing Distance(TOLD) card. User can print or text the TOLD card from there.
